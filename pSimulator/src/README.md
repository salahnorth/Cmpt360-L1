# Cmpt360-Project
## DESCRIPTION

This is a project for CMPT360

> In this project, we aim to create a simulator.
> Up to now, we created a simulator by using FIFO, SJF, Round-Robin, and 
> Multilevel Feedback Queue (MLFQ) algorithms 
> Note: The project is still in progress

## INSTALLATION

> To compile, on the command line, type "make" (without "")
> To run the executable code, type

	make run-fifo	      --> to run FIFO algorithm
	make run-sjf	      --> to run SJF algorithm
	make run-rr	      --> to run round-robin algorithm
	make run-mlfq	      --> to run MLFQ algorithm
> For plotData.py (python code), type
	
	python3 plotData.py 1 --> to plot FIFO data
	python3 plotData.py 2 --> to plot SJF data
	python3 plotData.py 3 --> to plot round-robin data
	python3 plotData.py 4 --> to plot MLFQ data

> To clean, type "make clean" (without "")
